	\brief Provides the ability to browse a MediaServer.
*/

/*! \defgroup FilteringBrowser DLNA - Filtering Browser
	\brief This module allows browsing of a
	MediaServer's (e.g. DMS, M-DMS) content. Also works for DMS and M-DMS devices.
	
	\ref FilteringBrowser is built on top of the generated DeviceBuilder API.
	This module essentially provides a level of abstraction from 
	the UPnP communications, such that upper application layers
	can work with structs that represent content. 

	The \ref FilteringBrowser works in the following way.
	- <b>Browsing Contexts</b>
		- A \ref FilteringBrowser is designed to a browse 
			UPnP AV MediaServers (e.g. DMS, M-DMS devices).
		- A single \ref FilteringBrowser is capable of browsing
			one CDS container of a UPnP AV MediaServer at a time.
		- The CDS container that is being browsed is a <i>browsing context</i>.
		- A <i>browsing context</i> is more formally defined as the exact path
			to the CDS container that is being browsed. For example,
			<i>FB_AllRoots/Root Container of DMS/Container1</i> is an example
			of a complete browsing context.
	- <b>Results (Filtering & Pagination)</b>
		- When a \ref FilteringBrowser has a browsing context, it reports its results
			as a single <i>page</i> of <i>matched</i> (a.k.a. <i>post-filtered</i>)
			results.
		- <i>Matched/post-filtered</i> means that each CDS object (in the page of 
			results) has been matched against a filtering method that is
			assigned by the application layer.
		- Results are divided into <i>pages</i>. Each <i>page</i> contains only
			<i>matched/post-filtered</i> CDS objects.
		- Each page has a size. The page size is the maximum number of CDS objects
			that are associated with a single page of results.
		- A \ref FilteringBrowser has one page size for all of its results, although
			separate \ref FilteringBrowser instances can have different page sizes.
		- A \ref FilteringBrowser can change the page size of its results dynamically,
			although this requires the \ref FilteringBrowser to rebrowse the
			current context.
	- <b>Accurate vs Estimated Page Counting</b>
		- A \ref FilteringBrowser can be configured to estimate or accurately calculate the 
			number of pages for the current context+pagination+filtering configuration.
		- Estimating the number of pages uses the number of CDS objects in the container
			(which is obtained in every CDS:Browse request) divided by the page size.
		- Accurately counting the number of pages forces the \ref FilteringBrowser
			to count the number of CDS object in the container and divide by the page size.
	- <b>Browsing \ref FB_AllRoots</b>
		- The \ref FB_AllRoots container is a logical container that represents 
			the parent of all root containers of MediaServers.
	- <b> Setup of the FilteringBrowser </b>
		- Use \ref FB_CreateFilteringBrowser() to create a \ref FilteringBrowser
			instance.
		- After creating the \ref FilteringBrowser instance, applications use
			\ref FB_SetPageInfo() to specify the pagination/filtering configuration.
	- <b> Changing the browse context </b>
		- Use \ref FB_SetContext() to change the browsing context
			(i.e. the CDS container that is being browsed).
	- <b> Changing pages </b>
		- Use \ref FB_NextPreviousPage and \ref FB_SetPage to change
			target page.
	- <b> Accessing the results </b>
		- The callback for reporting results is excuted on a thread using the
			threadpool so that app layer doesn't have to worry
			about timing sensitivities. 
		executes on a thread that is 
			somewhat timing	sensitive. Control points monitor the
			SSDP multicast channel and using the thread too long (~3 seconds?)
			can cause an inconvenience of a missing a MediaServer
			advertisement or bye-bye message. 
			Generally, using the thread to update a GUI is fine and rarely
			causes problems, although having sufficient network buffers
			is usually limiting platform requirement.
		- To prevent the CDS objects in the results from being deallocated,
			the application layer will need to call \ref FB_GetResults() once,
			\ref CDS_CloneMediaObject() once for each CDS object, or 
			\ref CDS_ObjRef_Add() once for each CDS object.
			See \ref FB_Fn_ResultsUpdated for more information.

							Application access to \a results_page is thread-safe during
							execution of the callback because the callback will 
							execute on the microstack/control-point's thread.

							Applications that want to have thread-safe access the \a results_page
							after thread execution has returned to the \ref FilteringBrowser
							need to do one of the following things:
								-	call \ref FB_GetResults() to get a deep copy of each object
								-	call \ref CDS_CloneMediaObject() to get a deep copy of
									each objects of interest (in \a results_page)
								-	call \ref CDS_ObjRef_Add() to ensure that 
									objects of interest (in \a results_page) are not freed
							
							That being said, the only time the \ref FilteringBrowser will modify
							the memory associated with \a results_page will be if the application
							calls any of the methods that modify the state of the
							\ref FilteringBrowser.
